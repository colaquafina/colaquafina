## Ongoing Research Projects
1. Network control theory to identify the critical nodes and input signals from task fMRI.
   - **About: The human brain is an orderly dynamic system and it coordinates task-related regions hierarchically to perform a complex cognitive task. However, the underlying regulation mechanisms of how the brain organizes these neural circuits remain elusive from a computational perspective. Brain network control theory provides a basic theoretical architecture for linking brain structure and functional dynamics. In our study, we utilize the network control theory to reveal the relationships between the brain's anatomical structure and the observed coactivation pattern of cognitive function.
   - **Method: We constructed a linear model to model the brain network and then used the pinning control strategy to input energy to the model, forcing the model output to track the real fMRI signals and optimize the node selectionsand input energy. We proposed to use the Half-Quadratic Splitting algorithm to solve the optimized model and analyze the controllability of the brain structure to determine how the brain balances energy consumption and neural circuit integration
