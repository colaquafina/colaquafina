## Ongoing Research Projects
1. **Use network control theory to identify the critical nodes and input signals from task fMRI**.
   - *About*: The human brain is an orderly dynamic system and it coordinates task-related regions hierarchically to perform a complex cognitive task. However, the underlying regulation mechanisms of how the brain organizes these neural circuits remain elusive from a computational perspective. Brain network control theory provides a basic theoretical architecture for linking brain structure and functional dynamics. In our study, we utilize the network control theory to reveal the relationships between the brain's anatomical structure and the observed coactivation pattern of cognitive function.
   - *Method*: We constructed a linear model to model the brain network and then used the pinning control strategy to input energy to the model, forcing the model output to track the real fMRI signals and optimize the node selectionsand input energy. We proposed to use the Half-Quadratic Splitting algorithm to solve the optimized model and analyze the controllability of the brain structure to determine how the brain balances energy consumption and neural circuit integration. We have already tested this framework in working memory task and identify the critical brain control regions and corresponding input energy. Now we are trying to expand the this framework to non-linear model to see if we can get similar results.

2. **Use radiomics and deep learning to predict the pituitary adenoma consistency**.
   - *About*: Pituitary macroadenoma consistency can influence the ease of lesion removal during surgery, especially when using a transsphenoidal approach. Unfortunately, it is not assessable on standard qualitative MRI. In this research, we want to combine radiomics, deep learning, and transfer learning to solve this problem with MRI images.
   - *Method*: For radiomics part, We collect the MRI images of pituitary adenoma of patients and preprocess the images. Then we use Pyradiomics to extract the features from the images and then use the Extra Tree Classifier to determine adenoma consistency. For the deep learning part, we use the U-net to extract the image features, then we freeze the parameters of the down-sampling and use the output of the U-net down sampling as the input of a classifier model to predict the adenoma consistency. We can get the classification result by combining results from two paths
  
3. **Use GNN to detect and classify the seizure according to the EEG data**.
   - *About*: Seizure is a common neuro degenerative disease. The diagnose of seizre is based on the analysis of the EEG data, which is time-consumting and low accuracy. Therefore, in this project, we try to use the deep learning method to improve the process of auto seizure detection and classification from the EEG data.
   - *Method*: To build a network based on the EEG data, it is necessary to include the connection between the EEG channles. Therefore GNN is used in this research to build network model.
